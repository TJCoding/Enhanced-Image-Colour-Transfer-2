OPTION 1: CrossCovarianceLimit
 There is an option to match the cross correlation between the colour channels of the target
 image to the correlation within the palette image. Full matching, no matching or restricted 
 matching may be specified.
   Set CrossCovarianceLimit to 0.0 to inhibit cross covariance processing.
   Set CrossCovarianceLimit to 1.0 for full cross covariance processing.
   Set to an intermediate value for intermediate processing.
   (See the note at the end of this file for further information.)


OPTION 2: PercentShadingShift
 There is an option to retain the shading of the target image so that the processing is 
 implemented as a pure colour transfer or to adopt the shading of the palette image 
 or to select an intermediate shading.
   Set percent shading shift to 100 for shading consistent with the palette image.
   Set percent shading shift to 0 to retain the target image shading.
   Set to an intermediate value for intermediate shading.
   Values outside the range 0.0-100.0 are permissible!


OPTION 3: ReshapingIterations
 There is an option to further match the distribution of the target image colour channels 
 to the corresponding palette image colour channels by iteratively adjusting the 
 characteristics over and above the basic processing sequence.  The number of 
 iterative adjustments can be specified for this 'reshaping' option. 
   Set the number of reshaping iterations to 0 for no reshaping processing.
   Set the number of reshaping iterations to 1 for a single rehaping iteration.
   Set the number of reshaping iterations to 'n' for 'n' reshaping iterations.


OPTION 4: PercentTint
 There is an option to modify the colour tint of the final image.
   Set percentage tint to 100.0 for a full colour image.
   Set percentage tint to 0.0 for a greyscale image.
   Set to an intermediate value for intermediate tint.
   Values outside the range 0.0-100.0 are permissible!


OPTION 5: PercentModified 
 There is an option to mix the final image with the initial image,
 so that only part modification occurs.
   Set percentage modification to 100 to achive the full processing outcome.
   Set percentage modification to 0 to retain the target image in full.
   Set to an intermediate value for intermediate modification.
   Values outside the range 0.0-100.0 are permissible!


OPTION 6: PercentSaturationShift
 There is an option to pare back excess colour saturation resulting from the 
 colour transfer processing.
   Set percent saturation shift to 100% for no paring back.
   Set percent saturation shift to 0% for full paring back.
   Set to an intermediate value for an intermediate degree of paring back.
   Set to '-1' for automatic parameter selection.
   Values above 100.0 are permissible!


OPTION 7: ExtraShading
 There is an option to further adjust the shading of the output image to match 
 the target image, the palette image or an intermediate image 
 (as selected under Option 2) by directly matching distributions in the 
 corresponding grey shade images.
   Set additional shading processing to 'ON' for enhanced shading processing.
   Set  additional shading processing to 'OFF' to revert to simple shading



** PROCESSING PRECEDENCE **
   PercentageTint is implemented first then PercentModified.

** REINHARD PROCESSING
   For standard Reinhard processing the parameters should be 0.0, 100, 0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, 100.0, OFF.  

** NOTE ON CROSS CORRELATION PROCESSING  **
   Cross correlation matching is performed by operations of the form.
   Channel_a = W1*Channel_a + W2*Channel_b
   Channel_b = W1*Channel_b + W2*Channel_a
   as determined by the value of CrossCovarianceLimit.

   If CrossCovarianceLimit = 0, W2=0 and no cross correlation
   matching is performed.
   If CrossCovarianceLimit > 0, W2 is clipped if necessary so
   that it cannot lie outside the range
   -CrossCovarianceLimit*W1 to +CrossCovarianceLimit*W1.
   This mechanism may be used to guard against an overly large
   correction term.
   Typically CrossCovarianceLimit might be set to 0.5
   (for a maximum modification corresponding to 50%).
